# DS4002 Project 3 – Facial Recognition: Accuracy by Age, Gender, and Race
## By: Enmanuel Baez, Keivon Chamanara, Nishita Cheekatamarla

## Overview

This repository contains all the source code, data, and outputs of this project. We used the DeepFace facial recognition library through Python to analyze its accuracy on 1,000 images of faces from different ages, genders, and races. Through our analysis, our goal was to determine which groups are more accurately classified by facial recognition software.

## Software and Platform

For this project, Python through a Jupyter notebook was used, which was all coded in Visual Studio Code. The Python libraries/packages installed include: DeepFace, TF-Keras, Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, OS, Pillow (PIL), and OpenCV (cv2). The platform used was a MacOS computer.

## Results Reproduction

To reproduce the results...

1. Go to the 'SCRIPTS' folder in the repository and click on 'Project3.ipynb'.
2. In the banner directly above the Jupyter notebook, there will be a download button to the right that says "Download raw file" when you hover over it. Click on it to download the notebook.
3. The Jupyter notebook will download to your device and you can open it in any code editor of your choosing. We will use Visual Studio Code (VSCode) for this example but other code editors work.
4. Once you open the project in VSCode (or the code editor of your choosing), there will be a button at the top that says "Run All". Click on it.
5. First, the import packages code block will run. If there is any library/package that you do not have installed, an error will show. To fix this, simply type "pip install [name of missing library/package]" in your command line interface. For Mac users this would just be in Terminal.
6. Then, you can go back to your code editor and press "Run All" again. The code will run as expected and all the graphs and modified dataframes will appear for your observation.
